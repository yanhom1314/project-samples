        2. You can load a template in many ways. For convenience, we'll include it in
        a script tag so that we don't need to mess around with AJAX or multiline strings.
        Note that we've set the type attribute to 'text/ractive' - though it can be
        just about anything except 'text/javascript'
      -->

      <p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>
      <p style='color: {{color}}; font-size: {{size}}em; font-family: {{font}};'>
        {{greeting}} {{name}}!
      </p>
      <!-- add the button here -->
      <button id='count'>Times this button has been clicked: {{counter}}</button>

        If you want the newest features (unstable!), use the 'edge' version instead:

        http://cdn.ractivejs.org/edge/ractive.min.js

        If you need IE8 support, change 'ractive' to 'ractive-legacy'.

        4. We've got an element in the DOM, we've created a template, and we've
        loaded the library - now it's time to build our Hello World app.
